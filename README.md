## Overview

### The challenge

Create a To Do List SPA (Single Page Application)

Users should be able to:

- View/Add Projects
- Add tasks to projects
- Set properties of to do's and projects
- Properties should be title, due date, checklist

## My process
My main objective for this project had little to do with design and more about the functionality and usage of the local storage to create, read, update, and delete items.

For my basic guideline design I used Figma- design URL: [Design](https://www.figma.com/file/sTsm6CXAEcNxer1ZhmOqbx/To-Do-App-Design?node-id=0%3A1)

After Which my list of priorities went as follows

1. Create HTML with sample data to get the design elements implemented
2. After HTML is created. Use Javascript to create elements from Local Data storage
3. Create initial local storage data which javascript can utilize to create HTML
4. Update Javascript Functions for create, read, update, delete (Crud)
5. Delete HTML template and make Javascript creat all HTML from scratch



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- JS (javascript)
- Webpack
- Figma (For Design)

### What I learned

During this project I learned just how much sctructure is needed to use Modular JS effectively. As well as having the design flushed out before functionality is added. 

During this project I had to refactor the design multiple times in order for the functionality to be implemented correctly. These time consuming issues could have been avoided had my design been more basic and flushed out.

I learned more about timing and when memory is accessed vs when it is stored. During the project there were times where some of my functions were working as intended however they were still reading the old information instead of the new. 

This project definitly gave me a glance at just how much more in depth a project can be especially when working with storage let alone and backend.


### Continued development

I will continue to refactor my code and make it more readable as well as spend more time in the planning and design stages in order for better implementaion and more streamlined functionality
