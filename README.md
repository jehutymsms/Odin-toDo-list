## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View/Add books into the library to be displayed on cards
- Updated as of 9/13/21 with Modular JS
- Updated using Class instead of a factory function for adding books to library

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma
- Modular JS

### What I learned

I learned more about modular JS and about making functions do only 1 thing thus making it easier to find issues that occur.


### Continued development

In the future I want to learn to use React in order to broaden my skills.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Resource](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#background) - This helped me for Flexbox and has amazing visuals.
- [Grid Resource](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me for Grid and has amazing visuals.
